# NavigationPlugin
This is a navigation plugin for Cordova / PhoneGap based on BaiDu LBS.

Supported Platforms

Android


Note: The plugin is based on BaiDu LBS,which means it uses BaiDu's URI service to start navigation with BaiDu map client.You have to register BaiDu's relevant service(Android SDK) to get the key so that you can use its URI service.

  Once you get the key,then you can replace the key in AndroidManifest.xmlï¼Œlike this:
    <meta-data android:name="com.baidu.lbsapi.API_KEY"
		    android:value="your key" />

Using the plugin

The plugin creates the object navigator.HUBUNavigate with the method startNavigating(longtOrig,latOrig,longtDes,latDes);

A full example could be:


    function navigate() {  
           var longtOrig = 114.324775;
           var latOrig = 30.580747;
           var longtDes = 114.390421;
           var latDes = 30.501860;
           
           navigator.HUBUNavigate.startNavigating(longtOrig,latOrig,longtDes,latDes);
             }
